Digital protototypes of vending machine interfaces as art.

I think there is a lot of potential to create vending machines with unusual interfaces that straddle the art/commerce line. This repo is a place to quickly build and test interesting interactions.

## Conspire

How would your snacking choices differ if you had to collaborate to enact them?

In this model, two people must simultaneously work together (in two separate browsers) to make a selection and submit a selection. It is also a chance to try out PubNub for real-time interactions.

### Status

Proof of concept implemented and deployed. No styling.

## Opine

Use the USDA's food nutrition database as a training set to map a 'snack space'. From that create a minimum spanning set of axes (or maybe slightly below minimum, with some probabalistic elements). These can then be used as the back end for an abstract interface. Basically the machine looks at its contents, decides how to group and organize them, and then the users need to learn over time how to communicate with it in order to retrieve a particular snack.

### Status

Need to rebuild in rails

## Change

Change machine that provides a fun experience, and does return change, but not the full amount.

### Status

Older idea, should be pretty easy to mock up.
