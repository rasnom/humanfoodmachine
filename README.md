# Humanfoodmachines

Digital protototypes of vending machine interfaces as art.

## Conspire

How would your snacking choices differ if you had to collaborate to enact them?

Three people is where the overhead of coordination starts to be inevitable. In this model, two people must simultaneously work to make a selection while a third executes it.

Just starting (5/15/17)

Implement MVP as way to play with Pubnub.

## Opine

Use the USDA's food nutrition database as a training set to map a 'snack space'. From that create a minimum spanning set of axes (or maybe slightly below minimum, with some probabalistic elements). These can then be used as the back end for an abstract interface. Basically the machine looks at its contents, decides how to group and organize them, and then the users need to learn over time how to communicate with it in order to retrieve a particular snack.

### Status

Need to rebuild in rails

## Change

Change machine that provides a fun experience, and does return change, but not the full amount.

### Status

Older idea, but would be pretty easy to mock up.
